/*
  Blink
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the Uno and
  Leonardo, it is attached to digital pin 13. If you're unsure what
  pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the documentation at http://www.arduino.cc

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  // TODO:
  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  // wait for a second
  // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  // wait for a second
}
